Question 1:

The minimum number of perceptrons required to solve the XOR problem was a total of 3.
They were arranged in the following architecture:

1 hidden layer with 2 perceptrons.
1 output layer with 1 perceptron.

  ||      ||
  p1      p2        hidden layer 
   \      /
    \    /
     \  /
      p3            output layer
      |
    output

Question 2:

Perceptron p1 was trained as an AND gate, and perceptron p2 was trained as an OR gate. 
Perceptron p3 was trained to give the ouput of the XOR truth table.

With a learning rate of 0.8, it took a total of 16 training examples to learn the correct output.
The training examples are listed below:

Input:   Hidden layer output:  Training Label:
