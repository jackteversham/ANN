# Artificial Neural Network
Part 1:

neuralNetwork.cpp contains an algorithm that uses only perceptrons with threshold activation functions and the perceptron learning rule to solve the binary A XOR B problem.

Part 2:

A fully connected feed-forward neural network that consists of 3 input neurons, 2 hidden layer neurons and 1 output neuron. The hidden layer neurons and output neuron use the Sigmoid activation function.


To COMPILE:
  -> type make in src directory

TO RUN:
--> to run part1: execute command 'make run'
  --> output is sent to console and 'Output.txt'

--> to run part2: execute command './part2'
   --> output is sent to console

   NOTE on running on Nightmare: Run make clean, then make, then run the executables. 
                                 For some reason the executables compiled on my machine must be re-compiled before they are run on the CS machine.


To Clean:
 ---> make clean

 Executable names:
 --> part1: neuralNetwork
 --> part2: part2
